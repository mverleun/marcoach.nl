# iOS 7 Seminar

On 26 January 2014 I&#8217;ll be presenting about iOS 7 again. This  is the second time CMM is organizing this iOS 7 Seminar.

If you would like to attend as well please let CMM know via this link.

## Contents

In this session I&#8217;ll talk and show new features in iOS 7 that anyone responsible for managing iOS devices should be aware off. I&#8217;ll talk about some of the new security features  and what the impact could be on organizations, I&#8217;ll demonstrate nice features for schools where teachers can be in control of what is happening in a classroom and more.
