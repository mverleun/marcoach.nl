Since the launch of Mavericks and iOS 7 I&#8217;ve worked hard to update the [iOS 101 Support Essentials](http://www.marcoach.nl/training-portfolio/apple-ios/ios-101-support-essentials/ "iOS 101, Support Essentials") Â and to write the [OS X for PC Technicians](http://www.marcoach.nl/training-portfolio/apple-os-x/os-x-pc-technicians/ "OS X for PC Technicians") trainings.

The iOS 101 is now completely focussed on iOS 7 and the topics have been updated to be more relevant.

OS X for PC Technicians has become a two day class. It also covers most topics that are covered in the Mac Basic Integration training.
