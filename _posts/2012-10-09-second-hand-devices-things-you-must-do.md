Yesterday I received an email  from somebody who bought a second hand Mac Book asking for help. His device was remotely locked after he had used it for several weeks.

This made me wonder what had happened and how this could have been prevented assuming that the purchase was an honest purchase.

Whenever you purchase a second hand iPad, iPhone, Mac Book, iMac or any other tablet, phone or laptop that is under active control of a MDM solution, or has an iCloud configuration, this could happen to anyone. As long as the device is connected to the internet it will contact the MDM and/or iCloud servers. If one of these sends a remote lock instruction guess what happens&#8230;

With a bit of luck you ‘only’ use your data and you can reinstall or reconfigure your device. If not you  may end up with a device that is completely locked and not usable anymore.

The lesson learned is to always reinstall or reconfigure your device from scratch. Either reset the device to factory default (iOS devices) or reinstall the OS (Mac book) with a clean disk (no reinstall!)

A clean install also removes potential malware and/or back doors. Disclaimer: All information posted is written with the upmost care and valid at the time of writing. Changes in versions can supersede the provided information. Please use your own judgement.
