# Find my iPhone

Is a great feature that has been in iOS for quite some time. With the introduction of iOS 7 Apple has extended it with a feature to discourage theft: [Activation Lock](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818 "iCloud: Activation lock"). (Re)activating iOS is only possible if you know the password of the Apple ID that is used with iCloud.

If you don&#8217;t know this password you can&#8217;t reinstall OS X or reset the device to factory defaults if the device is not a supervised device.

# Supervised Devices

If you use Apple Configurator to make the device a supervised device than Activation Lock will not be enabled if the user enables &#8216;Find my iPhone&#8217;. You&#8217;ll be able to [reactivate the device.](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5927) Disclaimer: All information posted is written with the upmost care and valid at the time of writing.
