# Nagios

I monitor my systems, services and network with [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org). I&#8217;m using different ways to deliver notifications if Nagios has the need to inform me. Until now I used [Prowl](http://www.prowlapp.com) to send a push notification. Prowl would then open [Touchmon](http://www.s-team.at), a front-end app for iOS. This is a two step process where the initial message is displayed by Prowl. It works good, but there is no good first impression.

# MobiosPush

A more elegant, and cheaper, solution is provided by [MobiosPush](http://www.isnapp.nl/mobiospush/). An app that can receive push notifications directly. This removes Prowl from the chain and gives a more clearer first impression when the notification is received.

## Installing MobiosPush

Installing is rather straight forward. First buyÂ the app and install it on your iOS device. Enter information how this app can contact your Nagios server and press &#8216;Get configuration details&#8217;.

This will send an email with all the information that you need to configure your Nagios server.
