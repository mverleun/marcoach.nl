Â With the introduction of OS X 10.9, Mavericks, I had to certify as well to maintain my status as Apple Certified Trainer.

Today I passed the exam and I&#8217;m looking forward to delivering this training. Disclaimer: All information posted is written with the upmost care and valid at the time of writing. Changes in versions can supersede the provided information. Please use your own judgement.
