How do you deploy tens, hundreds or even thousands of iOS devices? Manually configuring every device is one way of doing it.

But&#8230; How do you alter settings on the devices already handed over to the user? Or how do you make sure devices are meeting your security standards?

Questions like these and more are addressed in the [iOS 201](http://www.marcoach.nl/ios-201-deploying-and-managing-ios-devices/ "iOS 201: Deploying and Managing iOS devices") training that MarCoach has developped.<!--more-->

Students will learn how to prepare iOS devices with Apple Configurator, a free download, capable of configuring 30 devices simultaniously. Configuring meaning updating the OS, configuring the device using profiles, installing free and payed apps and Â enrolling it in a MDM solution. For this purpose I have registered a special domain, <a href="http://www.profile-manager.com/" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">www.profile-manager.com</a>, which allows the student systems to work with an official certificate protecting the website. Without an official certificate it would be very difficult to enroll iOS devices in the MDM.

A MDM solution, Profile Manager, is also covered. The students will learn how to remotely configure devices, wipe them, install and update apps.

If this seems to much for your organisation they will also learn how to use a webportal to distribute settings and apps and use Microsoft Exchange to remotely secure and wipe devices.

This training is not an official Apple Training and is available for training centres who want to offer this training to their customers.
