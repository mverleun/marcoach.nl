# iOS Training, iPad Training

When companies are facing a roll-out of a large number of iOS devices they probably want their staff to be trained to use the device as efficient as possible. The internal training department knows the business, the applications and the (security) policies better than any external trainer and often they operate more cost effective as well.<!--more-->

But what do internal trainers know about iOS devices? How can they prepare for the user questions they may get? Where can they get expert answers? How do you make sure they don&#8217;t compromise security policies when advising their students?<!--more-->

Of course they attend courses like the [iOS 101](http://www.marcoach.nl/ipad-voor-service-medewerkers/ "iOS 101, Support Essentials") and maybe the [iOS 201](http://www.marcoach.nl/ios-201-deploying-and-managing-ios-devices/ "iOS 201: Deploying and Managing iOS devices") to prepare for this task. This will educate them about iOS to a higher level than would be required from iOS users.

But&#8230; They still haven&#8217;t learned how to use the iPad in a class, demonstrating the iPad using AirPlay and have to stay up-to-date. iOS is still rapidly evolving with one major release each year.

I&#8217;m considering to offer more than just a training for these people.

It would be a training focussing on presenting the basics users need to know, how to use AirPlay to present smoothly, how to prepare a classroom. This training will be complemented with access to a dedicated website where trainers can download presentations they can use to teach. This website also would contain information about the different releases and can be used to post questions and find answers. It should also allow for sharing information about Apps with peer trainers.

On regular basis I would organize follow-up training as well to educate the trainers about the new features and changes.

Before I start working on this I need to know if there is a market. So please share your thoughts with me. Disclaimer: All information posted is written with the upmost care and valid at the time of writing. Changes in versions can supersede the provided information. Please use your own judgement.
