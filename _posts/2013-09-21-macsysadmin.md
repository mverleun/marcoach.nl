Last week the [MacSysAdmin](http://www.macsysadmin.se) event took place in Gothenburg, Sweden. This annual event is organized by [Apoio](http://www.apoio.se)Â and is one of the most important European events.

Getting this well organized is demanding and when Apoio got an urgent request from one of Swedens biggest resellers in education to run a Mountain Lion bootcamp training during the week of the event they reached out for help.

I was lucky enough to be able to help them provide training to the employees of the reseller and to be the night guest during the evening events of MacSysAdmin.

Both worked out extremely well. All the students passed their exams with high marks and I met a lot of very nice people.
