# ICT-Noord conference

I&#8217;ll speak about iOS 7 again on 5 February 2014. This time I&#8217;m a guest speaker at the [ICT-Noord conference.](http://www.ict-noord.nl/conferentie/)Â The focus of this conference is entirely on education and they have a very interesting program. It&#8217;s not only technology.

ICT-Noord is a collaboration of more than 40 schools in the north of the Netherlands.

## iOS 7 in Education

This is the topic I&#8217;ll be addressing twice. In first session the focus is on teacher. How can they control what is going on in their classroom, e.g. launch Apps on students iPads, control access to a Apple TV and manage ebooks for classes.

The second session is IT focussed. I&#8217;ll talk about supervised vs not supervised devices, push notifications, management profiles and more.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">It is ment to be vendor agnostic towards solutions presented but during the presentation I&#8217;ll be using Casper Focus from Jamf and a BR-200AP router from Aerohive.</span>
