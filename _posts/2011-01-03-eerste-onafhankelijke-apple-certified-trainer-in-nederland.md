MarCoach is now able to support Apple Authorized Training Centers (AATC) who want to deliver Apple IT-Pro courses to their customers.

In July 2010 I have passed my TTT exam at Apples office in London and am proud to call myself Â Apple Certified Trainer (ACT). At the time of this writing I was the 6th certified trainer in the Netherlands.

Certification as a trainer was a logical step forward. For years I&#8217;ve been supporting, consulting and training customers with Linux and Unix. OS X and OS X Server are Unix based systems as well making it relative easy to certify as an Apple Certified Support Professional and as an Apple Certified Technical Consultant.

You can verify my certification status on the [Apple Certified Professionals Registry](http://www.apple.com/certification/verify) website. Note that it doesn&#8217;t show all past certifications or trainer certifications. The last one is visible only to AATCs.
