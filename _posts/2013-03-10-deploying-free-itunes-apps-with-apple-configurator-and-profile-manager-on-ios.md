Have you ever tried to deploy a free iTunes App on the mobile devices of your users with Profile Manager? If so you have probably noticed that the device will prompt you for a Apple ID and Password as soon as your users try to open this App. Apple Configurator on the other hand is very well suited to distribute free Apps and won’t prompt for the Apple ID that was used to obtain the App.

I recently noticed that after you use Apple Configurator to install a free App you can install more free Apps with Profile Manager if they are downloaded from the iTunes App store using the same Apple ID.
