# iCloud is for personal usage

The [iCloud terms and conditions](http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html) are clear that iCloud is for personal usage. iCloud allows you to share contact information between devices that are configured to use iCloud and use the same Apple ID to sign in to iCloud. In other words, it keeps the data synchronized between these devices. Besides that, iCloud offers much more but the focus of this post is on the information sharing.

When you&#8217;re running a small business you might be tempted, or ill advised, to use an iCloud account to share information with your colleagues. It seems straight forward, just configure all the devices within your organization with the same Apple ID and off you go. On the side you&#8217;re saving on the purchases of Apps as well, which is a violation of the [iTunes terms and conditions](http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html) by the way, but who cares? Well, I do.

## Ease of setup

If the ease of setup is the reason why iCloud is used for sharing purposes it is quite likely that the same Apple ID is used for Face Time, iTunes (App Store) and iCloud.

This is where you might end up with something like a mess&#8230; Passwords for websites are shared between different persons if iCloud Keychain is enabled. FaceTime calls are received on all devices because all phone numbers and email addresses are added to the Apple ID and the list goes on.

## Let&#8217;s use multiple Apple ID&#8217;s

Well, that seems to be a work around. The terms and conditions are still not adhered to but at least you&#8217;ll have the ability to use another Apple ID for FaceTime, giving you a sense of privacy again.

You&#8217;ll loose the ease of setup because you have to enter different Apple ID&#8217;s for different purposes. So why go down this road in stead of doing it proper?

## The correct way.

Many organizations either have their own server Â (OS X Server, Microsoft Exchange) that are equipped well to offer calendar and address book features. Other organizations use cloud services such as Google Apps to do the same.

Using these services allows you to adhere to the terms and conditions, avoids receiving FaceTime calls that are not ment for you etc. etc. and most important: There is a clear distinction again on which accounts are personal (private) and which ones are institutional (business) accounts.
