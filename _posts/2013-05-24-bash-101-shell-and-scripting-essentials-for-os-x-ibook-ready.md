# Command Line

Working on the command line reveals a lot of possibilities not found in GUI tools. Writing scripts can extend the functionality of your system and automate tasks allowing you to do things you&#8217;ve never done before.<!--more-->

For a limited time I&#8217;m offering this book as a free download. Eventually it will be available through the iBooks Store.
