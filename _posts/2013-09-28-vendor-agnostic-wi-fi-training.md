I just got back from a three day training with Apple in London.

The first two days were focussing on Wi-Fi implementations. This was really in-depth training focussing on the behavior of Wi-Fi signals, the protocols, the standards, how clients behave and how roaming works. We also learned how to plan for a good implementation meeting the requirements of the Wi-Fi users.

There was much more to learn then I could imagine upfront and would like to thank the people from Apple for organizing this. This also includes a big thanks to the people from Aerohives who had sent one of their best trainers to educate us.
