I&#8217;m proud to be able to call myself [Apple Certified Master Trainer.](http://www.marcoach.nl/training-portfolio/ "Training Portfolio")[<img class="alignnone  wp-image-757" alt="Certified_Master_Trainer_Technical_1ln_Blk" src="http://www.marcoach.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Certified_Master_Trainer_Technical_1ln_Blk.png" width="456" height="80" srcset="https://www.marcoach.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Certified_Master_Trainer_Technical_1ln_Blk.png 760w, https://www.marcoach.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Certified_Master_Trainer_Technical_1ln_Blk-300x52.png 300w, https://www.marcoach.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Certified_Master_Trainer_Technical_1ln_Blk-624x109.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" />](http://www.marcoach.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Certified_Master_Trainer_Technical_1ln_Blk.png)

&#8220;This new certification recognizes IT ACTs who build their skills and knowledge around Apple technologies, and enables training centers to connect with the trainers whose skills best match their business. IT Master Trainers stand out as experts and evangelists, and will be first to be considered for betas and training projects across all Apple programs.&#8221; is how Apple describes the certification.

This assures customers that I&#8217;ve got what it takes to help them. As a trainer or as a consultant. Disclaimer: All information posted is written with the upmost care and valid at the time of writing. Changes in versions can supersede the provided information. Please use your own judgement.
