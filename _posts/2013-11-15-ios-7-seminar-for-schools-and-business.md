# iOS 7 Seminar

On 12 December 2013 I&#8217;ll be presenting about iOS 7 again. This time CMM is organizing an iOS 7 Seminar. Unfortunate there is more interest than CMM can accommodate. That&#8217;s why the same event will be held again in January 2014.

If you would like to attend as well please let CMM know via this link.

## Contents

In this session I&#8217;ll talk and show new features in iOS 7 that anyone responsible for managing iOS devices should be aware off. I&#8217;ll talk about some of the new security features Â and what the impact could be on organizations, I&#8217;ll demonstrate nice features for schools where teachers can be in control of what is happening in a classroom and more.
