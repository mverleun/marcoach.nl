After a period in which users choose their own Linux distribution which they installed themselves the Rijks Universiteit Groningen decided to develop their own. Based on Ubuntu they developed a distribution known as the LWP (Linux Work Place).

With this distribution they of course provide support. Members of the service-desks of the various faculties are providing this support. These members have to be comfortable with this distribution and must know how to troubleshoot a Linux system. Educating these people is an important part of the success of the LWP.

The University contacted <a href="http://www.startel.nl/" target="_blank">StarTel</a> to see if they could be of assistance. StarTel was more than willing to comply to this request and asked MarCoach to step in.

After an intake with the developers, representatives of the service desks and the project leader several learning objectives were identified which resulted in an education plan. This plan was translated into a one day training that has been delivered several times to all the service desk employees. With success, the members rated the training as &#8220;very appropriate for their job&#8221; and &#8220;good quality&#8221; training material.
