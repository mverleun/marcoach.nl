# iOS 7 and enterprises

Apple released iOS 7 with quite some nice features and a great new look. Many of these are well known by the users.

Inside iOS Apple has extended the manageability by allowing more settings to be controlled with profiles. To create more awareness of these features I worked with [StarTel](http://www.startel.nl) to organize a seminar focussing on some that are probably very interesting to enterprises and schools. Casper Suite from [Jamf](http://www.jamfsoftware.com) was used to demonstrate these features. Thanks folks at Jamf to allow me to use this great tool.<!--more-->

# Features? Which features?

iOS 7 has great new features. The ability to open documents from managed apps in unmanaged apps and vice versa to name one. The ability to remotely install apps and the proper configuration, the ability to preconfigure Apple TV&#8217;s and their passwords. Documents on an iOS device now can use the same fonts as the workstation on which they were created because you can install additional fonts on iOS devices. And that is not all.

## Classrooms

Jamf&#8217;s Casper Suite takes the new abilities one step further with [Casper Focus](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/casper-focus/id635738553?mt=8&uo=4). A great app that allows teachers to control a classroom with one or more Apple TV&#8217;s and student devices. Imagine a teacher who has the ability to lock the students iPad in an exam app. No cheating with iMessage or Google.

# The presentation

The slides used during the presentation are available for download using the link at the bottom. They are in Dutch, but the screenshots of Casper Suite are in English, so you&#8217;ll likely get a good impression.
