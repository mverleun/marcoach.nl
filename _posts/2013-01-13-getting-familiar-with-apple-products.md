&#8220;Getting Familiar with Apple Products&#8221; is a training that is developed on request and now made available to others as well. It&#8217;s a quick way for support staff to get some experience with Apple products. In one day they&#8217;ll get to configure but an OS X system and an iPad. This helps them to understand the differences between Windows and Apple&#8217;s products and better do their job in a BYOD environment where there is no official support for Apple products.
